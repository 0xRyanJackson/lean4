Equates pieces of the left-hand side of a goal to corresponding pieces of the right-hand side by
recursively applying congruence lemmas. For example, with `⊢ f as = g bs` we could get
two goals `⊢ f = g` and `⊢ as = bs`.

Syntax:
```
congr!
congr! n
congr! with x y z
congr! n with x y z
```
Here, `n` is a natural number and `x`, `y`, `z` are `rintro` patterns (like `h`, `rfl`, `⟨x, y⟩`,
`_`, `-`, `(h | h)`, etc.).

The `congr!` tactic is similar to `congr` but is more insistent in trying to equate left-hand sides
to right-hand sides of goals. Here is a list of things it can try:

- If `R` in `⊢ R x y` is a reflexive relation, it will convert the goal to `⊢ x = y` if possible.
  The list of reflexive relations is maintained using the `@[refl]` attribute.
  As a special case, `⊢ p ↔ q` is converted to `⊢ p = q` during congruence processing and then
  returned to `⊢ p ↔ q` form at the end.

- If there is a user congruence lemma associated to the goal (for instance, a `@[congr]`-tagged
  lemma applying to `⊢ List.map f xs = List.map g ys`), then it will use that.

- It uses a congruence lemma generator at least as capable as the one used by `congr` and `simp`.
  If there is a subexpression that can be rewritten by `simp`, then `congr!` should be able
  to generate an equality for it.

- It can do congruences of pi types using lemmas like `implies_congr` and `pi_congr`.

- Before applying congruences, it will run the `intros` tactic automatically.
  The introduced variables can be given names using a `with` clause.
  This helps when congruence lemmas provide additional assumptions in hypotheses.

- When there is an equality between functions, so long as at least one is obviously a lambda, we
  apply `funext` or `hfunext`, which allows for congruence of lambda bodies.

- It can try to close goals using a few strategies, including checking
  definitional equality, trying to apply `Subsingleton.elim` or `proof_irrel_heq`, and using the
  `assumption` tactic.

The optional parameter is the depth of the recursive applications.
This is useful when `congr!` is too aggressive in breaking down the goal.
For example, given `⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`,
`congr!` produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and `⊢ y = x`,
while `congr! 2` produces the intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.

The `congr!` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
```lean
congr! (config := {transparency := .default}) 2
```
This overrides the default, which is to apply congruence lemmas at reducible transparency.

The `congr!` tactic is aggressive with equating two sides of everything. There is a predefined
configuration that uses a different strategy:
Try
```lean
congr! (config := .unfoldSameFun)
```
This only allows congruences between functions applications of definitionally equal functions,
and it applies congruence lemmas at default transparency (rather than just reducible).
This is somewhat like `congr`.

See `Congr!.Config` for all options.

The `exact e` and `refine e` tactics require a term `e` whose type is
definitionally equal to the goal. `convert e` is similar to `refine e`,
but the type of `e` is not required to exactly match the
goal. Instead, new goals are created for differences between the type
of `e` and the goal using the same strategies as the `congr!` tactic.
For example, in the proof state

```lean
n : ℕ,
e : Prime (2 * n + 1)
⊢ Prime (n + n + 1)
```

the tactic `convert e using 2` will change the goal to

```lean
⊢ n + n = 2 * n
```

In this example, the new goal can be solved using `ring`.

The `using 2` indicates it should iterate the congruence algorithm up to two times,
where `convert e` would use an unrestricted number of iterations and lead to two
impossible goals: `⊢ HAdd.hAdd = HMul.hMul` and `⊢ n = 2`.

A variant configuration is `convert (config := .unfoldSameFun) e`, which only equates function
applications for the same function (while doing so at the higher `default` transparency).
This gives the same goal of `⊢ n + n = 2 * n` without needing `using 2`.

The `convert` tactic applies congruence lemmas eagerly before reducing,
therefore it can fail in cases where `exact` succeeds:
```lean
def p (n : ℕ) := True
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by exact h -- succeeds
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by convert h -- fails, with leftover goal `1 = 0`
```
Limiting the depth of recursion can help with this. For example, `convert h using 1` will work
in this case.

The syntax `convert ← e` will reverse the direction of the new goals
(producing `⊢ 2 * n = n + n` in this example).

Internally, `convert e` works by creating a new goal asserting that
the goal equals the type of `e`, then simplifying it using
`congr!`. The syntax `convert e using n` can be used to control the
depth of matching (like `congr! n`). In the example, `convert e using 1`
would produce a new goal `⊢ n + n + 1 = 2 * n + 1`.

Refer to the `congr!` tactic to understand the congruence operations. One of its many
features is that if `x y : t` and an instance `Subsingleton t` is in scope,
then any goals of the form `x = y` are solved automatically.

Like `congr!`, `convert` takes an optional `with` clause of `rintro` patterns,
for example `convert e using n with x y z`.

The `convert` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
```lean
convert (config := {transparency := .default}) h
```
These are passed to `congr!`. See `Congr!.Config` for options.

`convert_to g using n` attempts to change the current goal to `g`, but unlike `change`,
it will generate equality proof obligations using `congr! n` to resolve discrepancies.
`convert_to g` defaults to using `congr! 1`.
`convert_to` is similar to `convert`, but `convert_to` takes a type (the desired subgoal) while
`convert` takes a proof term.
That is, `convert_to g using n` is equivalent to `convert (?_ : g) using n`.

The syntax for `convert_to` is the same as for `convert`, and it has variations such as
`convert_to ← g` and `convert_to (config := {transparency := .default}) g`.

`ac_change g using n` is `convert_to g using n` followed by `ac_rfl`. It is useful for
rearranging/reassociating e.g. sums:
```lean
example (a b c d e f g N : ℕ) : (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f) + g ≤ N := by
  ac_change a + d + e + f + c + g + b ≤ _
