termination_by.lean:64:6-64:11: error: Missing `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with isEven, which has a `termination_by` clause.
termination_by.lean:81:6-81:7: error: Missing `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test.f, which has a `termination_by` clause.
termination_by.lean:97:2-97:27: error: Invalid `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test2.f, which has a `termination_by structurally` so this one also needs to be marked `structurally` clause.
termination_by.lean:115:2-115:40: error: Invalid `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test3.f, which is not marked as `structurally` so this one canot be `structurally` either.
termination_by.lean:125:6-125:7: error: Missing `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test4.g, which has a `termination_by` clause.
termination_by.lean:152:2-152:21: error: Invalid `decreasing_by`; this function is marked as structurally recursive, so no explicit termination proof is needed.
