structural recursion cannot be used

Could not find a decreasing measure.
The arguments relate at each recursive call as follows:
(<, ≤, =: relation proved, ? all proofs failed, _: no proof attempted)
            i #1 #2

5) 48:8-20  _  ?  ≤

structural recursion does not handle mutually recursive functions
