argument #1 was not used for structural recursion
  failed to eliminate recursive application
    nonTerminating (Nat.succ n)

structural recursion cannot be used

failed to prove termination, possible solutions:
  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the remaining goals
  - Use `termination_by` to specify a different well-founded relation
  - Use `decreasing_by` to specify your own tactic for discharging this kind of goal
n : Nat
⊢ Nat.succ n < n
